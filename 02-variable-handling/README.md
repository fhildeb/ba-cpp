## Calculations

> `/calculations`

Bundled Knowledge to use automated compiling via makefiles and reading or operating with internal variables in different ways.

- **Instead-If**: Getting along without if statements for variable selection and operationsby using questionmark operators in a loop.
- **Operation**: on a 4 by 4 matrix element with multiple exceptions regarding values, diagonal elements, and skipping.

## Parameters

> `/parameters`

Reading out external parameters and acting on them in different ways by generating a terminal user interface.

## Pointer Reference

> `/pointer-reference`

Creating a subset of different pointer and reference scenarios with descriptions:

- bypassing `NULL` statements
- dereferencing and re-referencing
- syntactic and technical correctness
- arrays as pointers
- function pointers
- multi-dimensional array pointers
