# ba-cpp

BA C++ Course from the University of Applied Science Mittweida that took place in 2018.

## Course Content

From a fundamental understanding of minimal language development environments, compiler operations, and concurrency for threads and processes, to the nuanced topics of method handling and environment interactions, the course spanned a comprehensive spectrum for C++ programming.

Advanced concepts like template programming and pattern techniques were meticulously discussed and critical competencies in parallel and distributed computing fostered.

### Core Features

- Development environments for minimal languages
- Compiler, debugger, profiler
- Method handling, parameters, environment
- Variables, pointers, references
- Concurrency for threads and processes
- Classes, operators and casts
- Template programming
- Pattern techniques
- Parallel and distributed computing
